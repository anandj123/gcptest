## ‚òÅ Cloud Data Engineer interview preparation resources

The interview process is quite different for Cloud Data Engineering roles at big technology companies for candidates who have several years of experience.

The usual Algorithm and Data Structure is not the only components covered. Other areas of the interview process include:
  
- [Algorithms](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#-algorithms-introductory-practice)
- [Linux Troubleshooting](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#%EF%B8%8F-linux-troubleshooting)
- [System design](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#%EF%B8%8F-system-design)
- [Web Technologies](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#%EF%B8%8F-web-technologies)
- [Object oriented design](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#-object-oriented-design)
- [Database design](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#-database-designs)
- [Distributed systems](https://github.com/anandj123/gcptest/blob/master/interview/Interview%20Preparation%20resources%20for%20Cloud%20Data%20EngineersS.md#-distributed-systems-papers)

Other topics you should be familiar with are:  
- Project and program management
- Behevioral questions
  
I don't have any particular recommendations for the above 2 topics, but you can find tons of great resources on the web. I myself struggle to find good resources for them.

### üêº Algorithms (Introductory Practice)

If you have not been doing coding for a few years, the above list might be quite challenging and de-motivating. So for ease of transitioning into algorithms I recommend the following:

- [Codingbat (Introductory logic based)](https://codingbat.com/python)

Do introductory array based problems to get your thinking flowing.
Here are few array-based problems for our practice.

‚ûÅ PLUS ONE: Given an array of digits, return a new array of digits by adding one to the number.   
‚ûÇ In an array of integers, given an element, find the next largest number after that index which is present maximum times.  
‚ûÉ Given a number, convert it into a stream of binaries (0's and 1's). Check how many times 'k' consecutive 1's exist.   
  
Congratulations üëã, these should get you off to a great start

### ü§ñ Algorithms (Intermediate -> Expert Practice) [Not really needed for Data Engineering interviews you can mostly skip these]

Basic algorithms like:

- Binary Search
- BFS
- DFS 

and some common data structures like 

- List
- Map
- Set
- Priority Queue
- Queue
- Stack

Solving some 50-100 good quality problems should be good. The following links are all curated and validated (by the smartest people) highest quality problems you would find. 

- [Codingbat Recursion I (Highly recommended you solve these)](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1)
- [Codingbat Recursion II (Highly recommended you solve these)](https://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-2)
- [Grind 75 (at least solve the easy questions if possible)](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)
- [https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+interview](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=google+interview)

Preparing for coding interview is a very deep topic and I cannot write all about it in this page. But if you are up for it, I highly recommend the educative.io course 
- [Grokking the coding interview patterns](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-python)

They cover all the [14 basic coding interview patterns](https://www.teamblind.com/blog/index.php/2022/06/27/top-leetcode-patterns-coding-interview-questions/) and much more. The 14 patterns to learn are:

1. Sliding Window
2. Two pointers or iterators
3. Fast and slow pointers
4. Merge intervals
5. Cyclic sort
6. In-place reversal of linked list
7. Tree breadth-first search
8. Tree depth-first search
9. Two heaps
10. Subsets
11. Modified binary search
12. Top ‚ÄúK‚Äù elements
13. K-way merge
14. Topological sort

There are some books available also, but I feel these above resources are much more current and comprehensive.

### üñ•Ô∏è Linux Troubleshooting:
Knowing common troubleshooting commands is very important. These 2 resources I found to be very good to learn about some common troubleshooting commands and how to think about Linux troubleshooting. 

- [USE - Utilization Saturation Error methodology](http://www.brendangregg.com/USEmethod/use-linux.html)  
- [Linux performance analysis in 60 seconds](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55)  
  
##### üìó Linux Book:
This book is the bible. It's quite daunting to read it. So have it if you need to look up something quickly. If you have read it completely kudos to you!

[Linux System Administration Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Linux-System-Administration-Handbook/dp/0134277554/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3LOYUS1HYECFS&keywords=linux+administration&qid=1562519418&s=gateway&sprefix=linux+a%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-3)  

##### üìó SRE best practices:
SRE best practices is really good preparation for Cloud Infrastructure engineers. This is the gold standard now a days.

[https://landing.google.com/sre/books/](https://landing.google.com/sre/books/)  
   
---   
   

### ‚òÅÔ∏è System design:
Generally the interview process doesn't go too much deep into system design. So I would not spend a lot of time on this topic. Just knowing the terms and what they mean and few concerete examples of each service layer (e.g. Spanner, CloudSQL, Pub/Sub etc. or equivalent services in AWS or Azure) would be good to know. The interview won't be about designing a web-crawler or gmail. Those are for senior software engineer roles.

- [Scalability, Availability and Stability patterns](https://www.slideshare.net/jboner/scalability-availability-stability-patterns/)
- [System design interview links](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)

##### üìò Good Books
These are great books if you have more than a year to prepare. They are gold standard for distributed systems. Not really useful if you have a few months to prepare. But I highly recommend you read them sometime. They are definitely worth the effort.

- [Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343)
- [Real-Time Analytics: Techniques to Analyze and Visualize Streaming Data](http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Analytics-Techniques-Visualize-Streaming/dp/1118837916)

### üï∏Ô∏è Web Technologies:
This is an important topic. So make sure you brush up on this. These 3 links have a very good primer and from there you could dive deeper into each sections if they are not clear.

- [How the web works 1: A Primer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-the-web-works-a-primer-for-newcomers-to-web-development-or-anyone-really-b4584e63585c/#.7l3tokoh1)

### ü•§ Object oriented design
This is a very broad topic. It's hard to cover it in a blog post. The easiest way to brush up is using a book. But mostly this topic should be just a brush up.

[Grokking the object oriented design interview](https://github.com/tssovi/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview)

### üì´ Database designs
Database design is probably the easy one to prepare. Every experienced candidate already has a good handle on this. So you could skip this section altogether if you feel you have a good handle on this.
